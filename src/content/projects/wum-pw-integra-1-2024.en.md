This project focused on developing **Mysh** (MYelin SHeath morphometry), an open-source tool for automated morphometric assessment of peripheral nerves in regenerative medicine research. The tool applies deep learning-based segmentation of axons and myelin sheaths in light microscopy images, supporting both immunohistochemical (IHC) and toluidine blue staining.

A representative database of 119 microscopic scans was compiled to train and validate the models under realistic laboratory conditions. The project also produced a standardized set of morphometric parameters for nerve regeneration studies and a systematic analysis of how image quality and preprocessing strategies affect segmentation performance.

**Mysh** outperforms existing tools such as AxonDeepSeg across all instance segmentation metrics and enables precise single-axon-level morphometric analysis. The tool is publicly available on GitHub.
